konnichiwa 👋🏻 all, Heading into 2025, it suddenly hit me that my readme page is not upto date. It sent me into an existential crisis, but hey its like peanut butter and jelly that i eat everyday for breakfast. Putting my procrastination on hold, low and behold i have updated by **readme** page

Okok, so there hasn’t been much changes, my readme is same as it was in 2021, which in turn is same as it was in 2019. so whats changed you ask, ahemmm… **Notion,** yes you heard that right, i am going all in on notion from creating my professional resume, cover letter to the latest readme.

I will be using this github [repo](https://github.com/mohidkazi/mohidkazi) for not only showing my github readme, but also creating a github page with custom domain sprinkled on top of it. note - if you are a paid notion user, you can publish your pages directly from within notion with custome domain on top.

ps - notion free does provide with 1 free site publishing option.

🙇🏻 I have been procrastinating on a lot of things which i wanted to try for a long time like learning guitar 🎸, go 👾, vim  🖥️, raspberry pi 🥧.

😼 I have been trying out new things like learning DSA, experimenting with frontend frameworks like vue, react and exploring cloud providers like aws, render etc.

✨ Something i have always wanted to try is designing but couldnt due to creative and artistic constraint.

Farewell speech 🥹 - The main motive to create this readme was i wanted to do a little experiment. I wanted to create an aesthetic 💅🏻 minimalistic simple and clean web ui using notion inspired by medium website.
